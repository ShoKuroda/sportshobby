FROM THE DEST OF:
ALHAJA MARYAM ABACHA.
EMAIL: alhajamaryam_abacha@yahoo.com


URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL


I am alhaja maryam abacha, former first lady of nigeria head of state late
GENERAL SANNI ABACHA who died on the 7th of june 1998 as a result of cardiac
arrest while on the seat of power.


may main aim of sending you this letter is to solicit for your assistance in
the relation to a matter of transfer of UNITED STATES SEVENTY FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS {US$75,000,000}from one of my late husbands private account which he
operated during the period he was in the office. the reason for this
immediate transfer is because since my husbands death,the present regime
have started probing my late husbands activities and wealth.

this information came to me through a member of the senate who is our fami ly
friend and one of my late husbands loyalists. in view of that i in agreement
with my family have consulted our family attorney, his very willing to
assist push this money out of Nigeria without any delay.

he further advised that we should look for reliable and truthful person from
abroad in whose account the money would be transferred, meanwhile our family
attorney by name CHIEF CHIMA NWACHUKWU have held meeting and concluded the
whole transfer arrangement with the bank manager where these money is lodge
and duly awaiting the foreign account where this fund would be transferred
into.
after i had deliberations with my family, we resolved that you will be
compensated with 20% of the total sum for nominating an account for this
purpose and any other assistance you will give.10% of the total sum has been
mapped out to pay all local and international expenses like telephone and
fax bills. Expenses you may incur in the processes of opening an account and
other expenses which may be incurred in the transfer processes,5% has been
concluded to the local bank manager here in Nigeria who would be
facilitating the transfer.

the bank manager has promised to conclude the transfer within 7 banking days
as soon as we receive your banking information which must include address of
the bank account name,account number,telephone,fax and telex number since
the money would be through
telegraphic {TT}.


i need your assistance urgently because the present regime has succeeded in
freezing three of my late husbands account and if this last account he
operated is frozen. my family will have nothing to lean on.


note that all correspondence relating to this transfer should be directed to
our family attorney who i have given all powers to handle it and for
security purposes since i have been bound from traveling out of the country
by the present civilian regime. be your brothers keeper and save our soul.
