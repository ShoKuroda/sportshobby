From Miss Catherine Koffi
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire
West Africa


Hi,


I am Catherine Koffi the only daughter of Mr& Mrs William Koffi, It is sad =
to say that he passed away mysteriouslyof my parent in France during one of=
 his business trips abroad year 25th.Febuary 2008.Though his sudden death w=
as linked or rather suspected to have been master minded by an uncle of his=
, who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth. My mother d=
ied when I was just 6 years old,and since then my father took me so special=
.


Before his death on Febuary 25 2008 he called the secretary who accompanied=
 him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Sixten million,sev=
en hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$16.700,000) left in a securit=
y company inside two metalic box. He further told him that he deposited the=
 money in my name,and finally issued a written instruction to his lawyer wh=
om he said is in possession of all thenecessary but legal documents to this=
 fund under the security company.


Note that the security company where my late Father made the deposit does n=
ot know that the consignment depositing under their custody contains money =
my late father declare the content to the security company as containing fa=
mily valuables for security reasons.


I am just 19 years old and an university undergraduate and really don't kno=
w what to do. Now I need an overseas account where I can transfer this fund=
s and after the transaction i will come and live with you and i'm ready to =
do anything of your choice. This is because I have suffered a lot of set ba=
cks as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.

The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life and i wished to i=
nveste under your care please. I am in a sincere desire of your humble assi=
stance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. =
Now permit me to ask these few questions:


1. Can you honestly help me?
2. Can I completely trust you? .


What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after =
the money is in your account while i finalise my education. Please,Consider=
 this
and get back to me as soon as possible.



sincere regards,

Miss Catherine Koffi
