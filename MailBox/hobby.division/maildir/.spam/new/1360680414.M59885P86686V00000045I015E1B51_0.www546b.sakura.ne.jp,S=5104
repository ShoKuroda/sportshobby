  Dear Confidant:

   I am sorry to send you this confidential email at this period of time
   when my Country Libya has just conducted one of the peaceful 
 elections.
   I am Mr. Omar Bin Haya. I was the head of Security and protocol to 
 Mr.
   Saadi Gaddafi, during the uprising, we escaped in Niger through the 
 help
   of Mr.Gary Peter a Canadian and security diplomat /expert, During the
   reign of Mr. Gaddafi, His son Mr. Saaid used me to open bank accounts 
 in
   Some parts of Europe and Gulf Region ( United Kingdom, Germany, Spain
   ,Belgian , United Arab Emirate , Egypt and Saudi Arabia ) since the
   situation is normalizing in Libya , we want to bring some of the 
 money
   to you so that you will partner with us investment funds in your
   Country. If you agree to help us, all investments in your Country 
 must
   have you are as the owners of the investment to avoid linking the
   Gaddafiâ€™s in the investment.

   Therefore if you agree to work with us, we will send you details of 
 the
   bank accounts and how the transaction will be conducted, we are in 
 touch
   with the bank official who will help us. Send us your full names,
   address, age, occupation and phone number.

   Currently I am in London to monitor the transaction. If you are
   sincerely interested to work with me , write to me on this email
   account: omar.haya001@yahoo.com

   Omar Bin Haya
