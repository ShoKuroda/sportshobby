<!-- This done Grandon suggested that the gunner open the lock on San Thoys
collar The task did not please him but he was too well trained a soldier to
quarrel with the orders of his sovereign and so carried out his distasteful
duty without a murmur  -->

<!-- As it moved forward this time the serpents red forked tongue darted
from its mouth appearing and disappearing with the rapidity of lightning
-->

<!-- As they marched toward the harbor Grandon heard the rattle of mattork
fire which continued for several minutes Then it suddenly stopped and he
concluded that the Valkars seeing that they had run into an ambush bad
retreated This he afterward learned was really the case  -->

<!-- True But this arrangement presents a rather knotty problem In the
first place there are two guards outside the door now instead of one In the
second place the wily Romojak has chained us to that carrion indicating San
Thoy who will surely make an outcry if we attempt an escape Of course we
can throttle him or dash his brains out against the wall but it would be
difficult to slay him so quietly that the guards outside the door would not
hear and at least suspect something amiss  -->

<p><!-- No no Majesty Spare me There is a misunderstanding I tried to
rescue Her Majesty We stopped at the cabin to wait for daylight that I
might take her to the Reabonian coast  --></p>
<p><!-- The howling from the village was deafening for some time but to
Grandons surprise it suddenly ceased altogether  --></p>
<p><!-- Grandon examined the mixture in the bowl before him It smelled
savory enough and upon tasting it he found that it was a mixture of flaked
fish and chopped mushrooms stewed together in a sauce that was highly
spiced and quite peppery His drinking bowl contained freshly brewed kova
slightly weak but palatable  --></p>
<p><!-- They set off once more Grandon leading closely followed by Vernia
So Lan and Kantar At a respectful distance behind tramped San Thoy and his
Band  --></p>
