Dearest One

Please I know this may come to you as surprise , because you do not know me, I need your assistance that is why I am writing you, it is my desire ofgoing into relationship with you. My name is Lady. Florince Hope A Nationality of UK (London) . I was married to the late Mr Hope James who was a gold merchant in Accra Ghana for nine years before he died in the year 2007.

We were married for twenty years with a son.he died after an illness that lasted for four long years. Before his death we were both born again Christians. When my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of $14Million U.S. Dollars) with one of the prime Bank in Ghana the Accra city Presently, this money is still with the bank. Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next two months due to my cancer problem.

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to orphanage homes/churches or better still a good Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I instructed here in.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going to. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. The doctor advised me not to answer any phone calls due to my health condition, my lawyer can always answer phone calls on my behalf.With God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Ghana where the fund is now . I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth.

 Please always be prayerful all through your life. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here. Expecting to hearing from you,

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Lady. Florince Hope
