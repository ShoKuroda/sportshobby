Dearest friend,

I am Dr. Oleksandr Rekhniuk, a personal treasurer to Mikhail Khodorkovsky the Richest man in Russia and  owner of the following companies:Chairman CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russian Largest Oil Company) Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank (A well reputable financial institution with its Branches all over the world), I want to reprofile the total sum of $165.3 Million US Dollars to your country or any part of world where you maintain an offshore account for immediate investment without barring any delay.

Website: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4482203.stm

It has been carefully networked with my experience and for the past three months I have worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation, if you can be honest with me, then you will take 35% of the total fund.

However, I am presently in London from where I will be handling the transaction with you for confidential reasons.

I will appreciate your help & cooperation.

Best Regards,

Dr. Oleksandr Rekhniuk
