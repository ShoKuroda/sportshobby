  I am writing you this mail after going through your brief profile,I am with your person convinced we can make a contribution to the less privileged in the society.  The purpose is for you and I to go into partnership.
 I am the solicitor to Eva Rausing/Hans Kristian Rausing,philanthropists who passed on with a large sum of money off the records of written will (Testament).
The money was proposed for charity.I do wish to partner with you thus transfer this money into your account legally.After that we  set up  charity home  and invest some.

We shall discuss on modalities when I receive your expression of interest

Thanks
Yours sincerely
Professor Surya P Subedi
