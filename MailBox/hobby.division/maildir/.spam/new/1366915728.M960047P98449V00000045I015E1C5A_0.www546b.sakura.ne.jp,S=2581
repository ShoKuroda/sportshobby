Do you trade that stock? Big PR released: SC XN could skyrocket 
due ban in offshore mining in Arctic! The Scout Exploration 
projects to capture 38 percent of the worlds remaining oil and 
gas in the Arctic see. It's Exciting!!! We shall see a gain 
tomorrow for quick cash just like earlier. With none promo 
pushing on Wed, I'm confident the promoters would go aggressive 
on this deal asap. Add 10000 shares of SC XN  - ride it for huge 
profit!
