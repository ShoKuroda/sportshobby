Sir,
I am Dr. Lamine Buka Bature; the Head of the Directorate of Petroleum and Pipeline Marketing (DPPM); the Nigerian government agency that exclusively conducts the international trade and distribution of Nigeria's Petroleum and products, which is why we also maintain a permanent presence here in the London International Petroleum Exchange (IPE).

We both know that spammers have in no small measure created a climate of suspicion and uncertainty in internet communication, thereby making it difficult for people to negotiate meaningful business relations over the internet. However, it is improper to judge everybody by that ugly phenomenon. 

I have US$23.8Million which I want to transfer into your account. I accumulated the fund by allocation and supply of excess quantity of petroleum to foreign buyers. Unfortunately, our payment method is such that all payments go straight into our (DPPM) account with the Central Financial institution where proceeds from all our sales are received. This is how the US$23.8million got trapped inside our (DPPM) account. 

As it is, I cannot pull or withdraw this US$23.8million from our account without proper documentations and reason. This is why I am sending this email to you. 
The only way I can withdraw the fund is by working with you to transfer it into your account as one of the many contract payments we are scheduled to process and transfer to contractors.
Yes, I will provide the necessary documentations and order the bank to process and transfer this fund to your account as a legitimate and due payment for a maintenance work that was done for us (the DPPM) some years ago. They would transfer the fund to your account without delay. 
Your profession or line of business does not matter at all.

Of course, I have already put the necessary arrangements in place to ensure the business is concluded within 10 working days and have the fund successfully moved into your account anywhere in the world. 
Upon conclusion; you would retain 10% of the fund, and the remaining 90% would be mine.

Please get back to me with the following details/items:

1. Your full name and address
2. Your company name and address (if any)
3. The photocopy of the name page of your valid international passport.
4. Your cell phone number for unrestricted access to you.

Yours sincerely,
Dr. L.B. Bature (Tel/Fax: +448458601036 +448458600993)
