<!-- In theory at least she was a thoroughgoing little aristocrat A
gentleman was always a gentleman There were exceptions like Tom to be sure
but even Tom could have reached up and seized the title had he coveted it
She rarely forgot that she was the mistress of Belle Plain and a Malroy
Just wherein a Malroy differed from the rest of the sons of men she had
never paused to consider it sufficed that there was a hazy Malroy genealogy
that went back to tidewater Virginia and then if one were not meanly
curious and would skip a generation or two that could not be accounted for
in ways any Malroy would accept one might triumphantly follow the family to
a red roofed Sussex manor house Altogether it was a highly satisfactory
genealogy and it had Bettys entire faith The Nortons were every bit as good
as the Malroys which was saying a great deal Their history was quite as
pretentious quite as vague and as hopelessly involved in the mists of
tradition  -->

<!-- There was the patter of small feet beyond Bettys door and little Steve
who looked more like a nice fat black Cupid than anything else rapped
softly at the same time he effected to squint through the keyhole  -->

<!-- Dont feel so bad Bruce she said brokenly I am not worth it I tried not
to love you I didnt want to She raised a white face to his  -->

<!-- It was this information she gleaned from Jeff that led Betty to
desperate lengths to the making of what her cooler judgment told her was a
desperate bargain  -->

<p><!-- The news of Charley Nortons murder spread quickly over the county
For two or three days bands of armed men scoured the woods and roads and
then this activity quite unproductive of any tangible results ceased
matters were allowed to rest with the constituted authorities namely Mr
Betts the sheriff and his deputies  --></p>
<p><!-- In the yard Carrington was waiting for her Jeff had just brought up
Nortons horse and though he made no display of weapons the Kentuckian had
fully armed himself  --></p>
<p><!-- Charley was regretful but firm Just as soon as he could mount his
horse he would ride down to Belle Plain She was not to distress herself on
his account he had been surprised but this should not happen again
--></p>
<p><!-- Betty did not answer him her eyes were fixed straight ahead the
last vestige of color had faded from her face and a deathly pallor was
there This was the crowning horror She felt the terrible injustice she was
doing the man at her side the depth and sincerity of his devotion was
something for which she could make no return Her lips trembled on the verge
of an avowal of her love for Carrington Presently she saw the church in its
grove of oaks in the shade of one of these stood Mr Bowens horse and buggy
