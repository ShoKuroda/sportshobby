<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dear Beneficiary,</span><br />
			<br />
			<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
Series of meetings have been held over the past 7 months with the
secretary general of the United Nations Organization. This ended 3 days
ago. It is obvious that you have not received your fund which is to the
tune of $5,200,000.00 due to past corrupt Governmental Officials who
almost held the fund to themselves for their selfish reason and some
individuals who have taken advantage of your fund all in an attempt to
swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and
unnecessary delay in the receipt of your fund.</span><br />
			<br />
			<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
The National Central Bureau of Interpol enhanced by the United Nations
and Federal Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate
to the current president of Nigeria his Excellency President Good luck
Jonathan to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owed to
you and other individuals and organizations who have been found not to
have receive their Contract Sum, Lottery/Gambling, Inheritance and the
likes. Now how would you like to receive your payment? Because we have
two method of payment which is by Check or by ATM card?</span><br />
			<br />
			<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
ATM Card: We will be issuing you a custom pin based ATM card which you
will use to withdraw up to $3,000 per day from any ATM machine that has
the Master Card Logo on it and the card have to be renewed in 4 years
time which is 2015. Also with the ATM card you will be able to transfer
your funds to your local bank account. The ATM card comes with a
handbook or manual to enlighten you about how to use it. Even if you do
not have a bank account.</span><br />
			<br />
			<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
Check: To be deposited in your bank for it to be cleared within three
working days. Your payment would be sent to you via any of your
preferred option and would be mailed to you via FedEx. Because we have
signed a contract with FedEx Express which should expire by the end of this month, you will only need to pay $312 instead of $585 saving you $273 So if you
pay before the end of this month you save $273 Take note that anyone asking
you for some kind of money above the usual fee is definitely a
fraudsters and you will have to stop communication with every other
person if you have been in contact with any. Also remember that all you
will ever have to spend is $312.00 nothing more! Nothing less! And we
guarantee the receipt of your fund to be successfully delivered to you
within the next 48hours after the receipt of payment has been confirmed.</span><br />
			<br />
			<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
Note: Everything has been taken care of by the Federal Government of
Nigeria, The United Nation and also the FBI and including taxes, custom
paper and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $312.</span><br />
			<br />
			<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fees for
shipping your ATM card is $585 but because FedEx have temporarily
discontinued the C.O.D which gives you the chance to pay when package
is delivered for international shipping We had to sign contract with
them for bulk shipping which makes the fees reduce from the actual fee
of $585 to $312 nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort!</span><br />
			<br />
			<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
