Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Wiikins Peter, I have been diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer
which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying for my
health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have
only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.

Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
any more. I once asked my lawyer and members of my family to close my
accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity
organization and to the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they
refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them
anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for
them.

The last of my money which no one knows of it, is the huge cash
deposit of Ten Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (USD10.5m)
that I have with a Security Company in United Arab Emirates for safe
keeping. I will want you to help me collect this deposit to enable me
come over to your country and disburse it to some charity
organizations and to the less privileged,for me to know if the
Almighty God will accept the offering and heal my disease or accept my
soul in his Kingdom.

Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in this
disbursement, to enable me forward to you the entire document which
will back you up to claim the funds on my behalf.

Remain blessed.

Wiikins
