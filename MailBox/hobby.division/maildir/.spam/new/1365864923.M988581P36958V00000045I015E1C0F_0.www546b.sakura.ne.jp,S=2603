Great intelligence for L B_T G - LIBERTY COAL ENERGY CORP - that 
will produce huge returns!

Buyout plans are back on the table that will boost L B_T G shares up 
to the $.20 - $.30 range. Currently L B_T G is selling for a very 
low price, so the upside is amazing! Competitors want to buy out L 
B_T G because of their massive coal find that can produce shale oil. 
Don't hesitate if you want to get rich on this take over prior to 
the rest of the public! Buy all the L B_T G you can get on Apr 15.
