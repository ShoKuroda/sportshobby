Dear Friend,

Complement of the day to you and your love ones

I hope my email will arrive to you at good time.
My name is Dr. Abbaas Zahid A-Basaq from Damascus Syria.
I am now 64 years old and retired. I was former personal investor & financial consultant advisers to
a Top Politician here in SYRIA.

Why I'm contacting you is to know if we can have a personal conversation.
Whatever truth you may brief me will be highly recommended.
Tell me more about your country, how good it will be to invest in your country.
Such as buying of properties, or real estate and some tourist places or any profitable investment venture that will yield good profit.

I will appreciate whatever result you may brief me.
Do let me know your idea and knowledge regarding this or any other profitable investment venture you may suggest.
I have the total of US$22,300,000.00 that I deposited in South east Asia and I am willing to order the transfer of the money to you for investment if you’re interested with my proposal.

In my next mail I will explain the full details of the project and interest, and then we reach an agreement on what will be your share from the money or investment.

I shall tell you more about myself when I read from you.
You may as well tell me little more about yourself when replying.

Waiting for your reply.
Thanks and best regards,
Dr. Abbaas.
Damascus,Syria: 6:15 AM.
