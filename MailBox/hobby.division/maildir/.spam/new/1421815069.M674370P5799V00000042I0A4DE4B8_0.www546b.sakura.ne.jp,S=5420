Hi,

Have you been watching the news? It looks like everything is just falling to pieces with the international community. 
Things are seriously going sideways. That stuff in Ukraine? 
You know what I think? I think we should make some quick cash and then get somewhere safe. 

I found this:

Check it out. 

Later dude.
