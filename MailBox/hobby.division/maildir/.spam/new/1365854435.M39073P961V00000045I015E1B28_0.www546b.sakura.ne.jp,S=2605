Breaking news for L B_TG - Liberty Coal - that will turn a quick 
profit.

Takeover offers are on a fast track that will boost L B_TG shares up 
to the $.20 - $.30 range. Today L B_TG is selling for a very low 
price, so the profit potential is huge. Other companies want to take 
over L B_TG because of their massive coal assets that can draw out 
shale oil. Move fast to profit on this buyout prior to other 
investors. Buy all the L B_TG you can find on April 15th!!!
