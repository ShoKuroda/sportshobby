Wonderful news for L_BTG - LIBERTY COAL ENERGY INC. - that 
will turn huge returns!

Takeover plans are on a fast track that will push L_BTG 
shares up to the $.20 - $.30 range. Today L_BTG is selling 
for pennies, so the upside is huge! Even Management want to 
take over L_BTG because of their massive coal supply that can 
draw out shale oil. Move fast to get rich on this information 
prior to the rest of the public. Buy every share of L_BTG you 
can get on Apr, 15!!!
