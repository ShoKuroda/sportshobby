=C2=A0Dear God's elect,
I believe you will do better than I think,
It is understandable that you may be a bit apprehensive because you do not =

eat sorrow in my heart, I decided to contact you due to the urgency of my s=
ituation, My Name is Mrs. Dorcas Bongara, Am contacting you from my country=
 Tunisia. I want to tell you this because I don=E2=80=99t have any other op=
tion than to tell you as I was touched to open up to you, I am married to L=
ate Dr. Anthony Bongara who worked with Tunisia embassy in Ouagadougou the =
capital city of Burkina Faso: in west Africa for nine years before he died =
in the year 2005. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died=
 after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. Since his death I de=
cided not to remarry again, when my late husband was alive he deposited the=
 sum of $7.2 USD Million (Seven million two hundred thousand dollars) with =
a bank in Ouagadougou ,
Presently this money still in the bank there. He made this money available =
for exportation of Gold from Burkina mining. Recently, My Doctor told me th=
at I would not last for the period of seven months due to cancer problem. T=
he one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my conditi=
on I decided to hand you over this mission to take care of the less-privile=
ged, you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I w=
ant you to take 30 Percent of the total money for your personal use While 7=
0% of the money will go to charity work" helping people in the street.
Because I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member=
, just to endeavour that the house of God is maintained. Am doing this so t=
hat God will forgive my sins and accept my soul because this sickness has s=
uffered me so much. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the co=
ntact of the bank in Burkina Faso and I will also instruct my lawyer to iss=
ue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of t=
he money in the bank that's if you assure me that you will act accordingly =
as I Stated herein.
