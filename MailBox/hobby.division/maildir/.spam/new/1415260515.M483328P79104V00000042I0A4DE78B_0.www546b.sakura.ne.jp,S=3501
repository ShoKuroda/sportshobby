Good day Sir/Ma

This offer is strictly confidential and genuine by virtue of its nature. 
I am the Director Nigeria health Manager for Ebola prevention and
management Dr. Okey Nwanyanwu, during my search for a business partner, I
came across your information from your web to receive an over invoice
budget for Ebola treatment in Nigeria. This fund has been removed for the
Ebola budget and has been moved to our neighboring country for safe
keeping pending when I will have a trustworthy person to work with.

The total cash involved is US$159, 000, 000, 00 only (One Fifty Nine
Million Dollars only)

The arrangement was successful with help of my friend who works with the
accounting department of our Apex bank who helped in perfecting all the
logistics for the movement of the said fund (over invoiced) through one
finance and security company close to my country.

Kindly reply for more details about you as to proceed with this claim.

I look forward to your response.

Regards,

Dr. Okey Nwanyanwu
