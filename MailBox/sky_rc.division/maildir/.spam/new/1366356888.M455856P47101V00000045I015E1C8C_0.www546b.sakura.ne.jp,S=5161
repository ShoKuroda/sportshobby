Good day dear=2C

I am very happy contacting you today and I strongly believe that you will be a good person to me=2E My name is Miss Juliana Ekudem=2E I am 20 years old from Bangkok =2CThailand =2E I am the only daughter of late Mr=2E Paiboon Ekudem=2E  My late father was a  former Director in the Stock Exchange  and also a politician here in my country before some evil men  attacked our house and kill my parents=2C Luckily to me=2C I was in school when the incident happened=2E
 
Before the death of my parents=2C my father told me that he deposited the sum of US$ 9=2C800=2C000=2E=28 Nine Million=2C Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars=29 with a Bank here in Thailand  under fixed suspense account and  he used my name as the next of kin=2E He also told me that his intention was to open a Bank account in overseas with my name and transfer the money for foreign business investments that I will manage when I grow up=2E

Please=2C my reasons of contacting you is to request for your co-operation and assistance to help me transfer this money into a foreign account of yours by providing a bank account either company's or your private account where the money can be remitted in your care since my late father did not open the foreign account for me before his death=2C so that I will join you over to your country for a business investment with my money and also to continue my new life and education  together with you and your family because I have nobody here with me=2E

I tried my best to withdraw some money out of the total money but the bank manager told me that my late father made an agreement with them that I cannot have access to the money in my country here unless it is transferred abroad for the business investment as he stated on the agreement=2E
 
If you agree on this=2C I will  give you 20% of the total money when transferred=2C then 5% will be given to you if you made any expenses on the cause of the transfer Please remember the confidentiality and urgency my mail required while I expect to hear from you=2E

Thanks Again=2E

Miss Juliana Ekudem=2E
