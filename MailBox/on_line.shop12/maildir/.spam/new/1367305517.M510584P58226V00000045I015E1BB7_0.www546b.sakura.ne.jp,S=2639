Cinema business is a massive element of financial growth for all countries! 
World Bank Group member IFC just dedicated $29 millions into new 
cinematography production. G_T_R_L is a good target for World Bank Group 
funding. It sells below 7 cent with a chance to hit $1.50 following a major 
financing deal! Add 16000 shares on April, 30!!! If WBG invests G_T_R_L, the 
share value can reach a buck!
