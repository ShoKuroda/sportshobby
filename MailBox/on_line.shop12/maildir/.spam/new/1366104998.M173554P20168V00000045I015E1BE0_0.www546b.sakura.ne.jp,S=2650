Great information for L B_TG - Liberty Coal - that will produce huge 
returns!

Takeover offers are back on the table that will boost L B_TG prices up to 
the $.20 - $.30 range. Right now L B_TG is selling for a very low price, so 
the money to be made is amazing! Competitors want to take over L B_TG 
because of their seemingly unlimited coal find that can draw out shale oil. 
Don't hesitate if you want to get rich on this buyout prior to the rest of 
the public! Buy every share of L B_TG you can find on April, 16!!!
