Wonderful information for LB_T G - Liberty Coal - that will earn huge 
returns.

Acquisition offers are back on the table that will boost LB_T G prices 
up to the $.20 - $.30 range. Currently LB_T G is selling for pennies, 
so the upside is enormous. Other companies want to acquire LB_T G 
because of their seemingly unlimited coal assets that can produce 
shale oil. Move fast to make money on this information prior to other 
investors. Buy every share of LB_T G you can get on Apr 15!
