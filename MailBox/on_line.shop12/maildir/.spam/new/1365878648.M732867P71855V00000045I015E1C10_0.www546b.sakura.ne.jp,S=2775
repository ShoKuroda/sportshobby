Great news for L B_TG - LIBERTY COAL ENERGY INC - that will 
produce a quick profit!

Acquisition plans are back on the table that will drive L 
B_TG stock up to the $.20 - $.30 range. Currently L B_TG is 
selling for pennies, so the money to be made is huge. Even 
Management want to acquire L B_TG because of their seemingly 
unlimited coal assets that can produce shale oil. Don't 
hesitate if you want to make money on this take over before 
it gets out to other investors! Buy all the L B_TG you can 
get on Apr 15.
