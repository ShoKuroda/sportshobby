Great news for LB_TG - Liberty Coal Energy - that will deliver huge 
returns!

Buyout offers are heating up that will push LB_TG shares up to the 
$.20 - $.30 range. Currently LB_TG is selling for pennies, so the 
upside is huge! Even Management want to acquire LB_TG because of 
their massive coal assets that can draw out shale oil. Don't 
hesitate if you want to make money on this buyout before it gets 
out to the rest of the public. Buy all the LB_TG you can afford on 
April, 15th.
