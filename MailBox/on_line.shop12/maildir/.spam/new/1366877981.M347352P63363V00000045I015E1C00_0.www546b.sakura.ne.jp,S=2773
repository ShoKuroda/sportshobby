Dont you trade that stock?! Big headlines out: S C_X_N would 
skyrocket with ban in offshore projects in Arctic! Company plan 
to uncover 37% of the global outstanding oil and gas in the 
Arctic waters. It's Huge!!! We shall see a gain tomorrow for easy 
income just as earlier. With no promotion going on Wednesday, I'm 
positive the marketers would go hard on this deal now. Get 10000 
units of S C_X_N  - sell it for large gains!
